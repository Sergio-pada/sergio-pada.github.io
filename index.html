                <p>This website is an online archive of exhibits for a fictional museum based on the artifacts described in The Time Machine by H.G. Wells.</p>
                <br>
                <p>This site was built with the use of: HTML, CSS, Javascript (Node.js), TensorFlow.JS, Chart.js, and PostgreSQL. The site uses a machine learning model built using TensorFlow.js to recommend exhibits to users based on their previous activity on the site. In addition to the machine learning model, the data on exhibits and users is aggregated and used for data visualizations on user activity accessable via the "Dashboard" page.</p>

                <h1 class="project-title">APPOINTMENT SCHEDULING APPLICATION</h1>
                <p>This desktop application is used to keep track of a company's appointments associated with a variety of customers and employees of the organization. Additionally, it is designed to handle appointment tracking across multiple countries. The application can also generate appointment schedules for customers and sort the appointments by their type and month.</p>
                <br>
                <p>This application was built using Java, JavaFX, and uses a MySQL Server. The program implements a user authentication system. In addition, it defines and manipulates data related to customers, appointments, and users. It can handle users across different time zones and countries through time zone conversion.</p>

                <h1 class="project-title">PACKAGE DELIVERY SYSTEM</h1>
                <p>This Python simulation is designed to optimize delivery routes across three package delivery trucks, minimizing the time delivery drivers spend on the road. The program not only facilitates real-time delivery tracking throughout the day but also calculates the distance of each package to its destination based on the current time of day.</p>                <br>
                <p>This project was built with the use of Python. Packages are sorted on each truck using the nearest neighbor algorithm on each packages address. It utilizes a custom hash table for the storage and retreival of package object data.</p>
